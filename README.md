### Huffman Coding: 
A technique used to optimize the size of encrypted data is known as Huffman coding. This process leverages two key principles:

1. **Variable-Length Symbol Encryption**: Each symbol is encrypted using a varying number of bits. Symbols occurring more frequently in a message require fewer bits (possibly down to a single bit for the most common symbol).

2. **Prefix Code Encryption**: Symbols are encrypted with a prefix code, ensuring efficient use of space by avoiding separate character encodings.

Huffman's algorithm outlines the procedure to generate a "symbol" - "code" mapping table for a specific message. The resulting codes adhere to the aforementioned principles.

Huffman coding plays a pivotal role in various familiar technologies, including compression algorithms like GZIP and PKZIP, as well as media codecs such as JPEG, MP3, and PNG. It's recommended to acquaint yourself with a brief and captivating video on this subject prior to commencing your task.

The scope of this paper encompasses the implementation of Huffman coding, along with a specific application variation thereof.
