# Greed-and-encryption

### Purpose of Work:
Consolidate knowledge of greedy algorithms on the example of the implementation of one of the most famous algorithms of this type - Huffman coding. Also, since this is the last practical in the term, you have the opportunity to collect additional points by completing different versions of a difficult task.

**Huffman coding** is a way to encrypt certain information to achieve maximum size efficiency. This is achieved due to two properties:

**Each symbol is encrypted with a variable number of bits** - the more often a certain symbol occurs in a message, the fewer bits it will take (up to one bit for the most frequent symbol)
Characters are encrypted with a prefix code in order not to waste space on separate characters
Actually, Huffman's algorithm describes how, given a certain message, to obtain a "symbol" - "code" substitution table for it, so that these codes satisfy the described properties.

Huffman coding is a very important part of many things you are familiar with, such as archiving algorithms (GZIP, PKZIP) or media codecs (JPEG, MP3, PNG). I recommend that you spend some time on a short and interesting video on the topic before starting the work.
